# :rainbow_flag: UltrakillPrideRadiance
An ULTRAKILL plugin that replaces the default radiance glow with pride flags.  
Requires [BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) to be installed.

## :pensive: A Tragic Story
So! It turns out this mod idea was already executed by **Not a Bot** in the ULTRAKILL discord a day before I began work on this.  
I essentially wasted my time making this.

Her mod can be found in the [ULTRAKILL Thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/NotABot/RadiantPride/).
